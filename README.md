# SQL-Workbench-Database-System

Recent projections indicate that over two-thirds of people over the age of 65 will need long- term care during their lifetime and that that age group will more than double over the next 30 years, reaching 88.5 million in 2050. (Ortman, Velkoff & Hogan, 2014). Long-term geriatric care services include a broad range of health, personal care, and support services that meet the needs of older people and others whose capacity for self-care is limited due to chronic illnesses, injuries, physical, cognitive, or mental disabilities, and other health-related conditions.

My project seeks to provide a descriptive, analytical, and detailed overview of a database management system designed for long-term care facilities. Implementing this type of information system will bring tremendous benefits to those facilities by assisting them with keeping track of their residents' health, diagnosis, and personal care.

One of the most significant benefits of a database management system is providing access to the data of all essential employees and residents at the facility from a centralized location. Moreover, this system will help improve data security and collaboration between team members, as well as boost a facility's overall productivity.
